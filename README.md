## PolarsPulse ðŸš€
*Fast, insightful data profiling for Polars DataFrames.*

PolarsPulse provides a suite of tools to quickly generate comprehensive data quality and descriptive statistics reports for your Polars DataFrames. It helps you understand your data's structure, identify potential issues like missing values, duplicates, outliers, and rare categories, and get a statistical overview, all leveraging the speed of Polars.

## Installation
```bash
pip install polarspulse
```

## Quick Start
```python
import polars as pl
from polarspulse import profile

# Create a sample DataFrame (replace with your actual data)
df = pl.DataFrame({
    "id": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10], # Duplicate ID
    "category": ["A", "B", "A", "C", "B", "A", "A", None, "C", "B", "B"], # Missing, Rare C?
    "value1": [10.1, 12.5, 9.8, 50.3, 11.0, 9.9, 10.5, 13.0, 1000.0, 11.5, 11.5], # Outlier? Duplicate row?
    "value2": [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], # Binary/Sparse
    "all_same": [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], # Zero Variance
    "date": pl.date_range(pl.Date(2024, 1, 1), pl.Date(2024, 1, 11), interval="1d", eager=True)
})

# Generate the profile reports
# (Using default thresholds for classification, outliers, rare levels etc.)
data_summary, column_summary, row_summary = profile(df)

# Explore the results
print("--- Data Summary ---")
print(data_summary)

print("\n--- Column Summary (Selected Columns) ---")
print(column_summary.select([
    "column", "col_class", "missing_prop", "dup_ind", "mean", "std", "sparsity",
    "outliers_ind", "rare_level_ind"
]))

print("\n--- Row Summary (First 5 Rows) ---")
print(row_summary.head(5))
```

This will produce three Polars DataFrames:
1. data_summary: A single-row DataFrame with overall statistics about the dataset (dimensions, memory, counts/indicators of problematic columns/rows).
2. column_summary: A DataFrame where each row corresponds to a column in the original data, containing detailed statistics (type classification, missingness, duplicates, numerical stats, outlier info, categorical info).
3.  row_summary: A DataFrame where each row corresponds to a row in the original data, containing row-level statistics (missingness, duplicate status, outlier presence, rare level presence).

## Core Functions
PolarsPulse is built around several core functions, orchestrated by the main profile function:

column_type_ident: Classifies columns into 'numerical', 'categorical', 'time', 'zero_variance', or 'other' based on data type and the number/proportion of unique values.
column_missing_prop / row_missing_prop: Calculate the count and proportion of missing (Null) values per column or per row.
column_dup_ind / row_dup_ind: Identify duplicate columns or rows based on their values.
num_stats: Computes detailed descriptive statistics for numerical columns (mean, std, quantiles, skewness, kurtosis, sparsity, range, IQR, CV, NaN/Inf indicators).
num_outlier_stats: Detects outliers in numerical columns using a robust IQR method applied to scaled data (value - median / IQR) and provides outlier counts/indicators per column and per row.
cat_stats: Analyzes categorical columns, providing frequency counts/proportions for each level, Gini index, cardinality, and identifies rare levels based on frequency thresholds. Generates indicators for columns containing rare levels and rows containing rare level values.
profile: The main entry point that calls the relevant underlying functions based on user flags (e.g., get_miss_stats=True, outlier_stats=True) and aggregates the results into the three summary DataFrames (data_profile, col_profile, row_profile).
